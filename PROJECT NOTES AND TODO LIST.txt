I have created some API for use in this core plugin, and for other Avalanche plugins. Most of this API is related
to accessing the folder and data file. To use this API, use the AvalancheAPI class, then you can easily access the
data file as a Bukkit configuration, plugin sections in the data file, and you can save the data there. Use the data
file for any information that needs to be there after the plugin disables, that isn't just options. For each plugin,
please create API for accessing its config, and also create a file with a unique name that uses Bukkit's
configuration API.

TO-DO LIST:
- Make the chat plugin work as an Avalanche plugin (I'll do that.)
- Create permissions plugin
- Create chunk claim plugin
- Create anti hack plugin
- Create any other plugin, preferably something Essentials doesn't have. =P

PS: Don't make anything that gives us special powers in the plugin. It would really suck to have such an awesome
plugin, then ruin our reputations and have it removed.
